# Image Analysis

Hello and welcome to my repository for the exercises of the course Image Analysis that I studied during my Erasmus+ Exchange Programme at VSB - Technical University of Ostrava.  

The OpenCV library will be used for image processing in C++.  

The initial code can be found at the page: http://mrl.cs.vsb.cz/people/gaura/ano_course.html .
